 # Welcome to my WWDC 2020 Playgroundd
 This year, I sadly didn't have as much time as I hoped. However, I was able to come up with a simple point and click minigame, inspired by the tv show Community.
 
 I hope you enjoy it ^-^
 
  * Callout(Hint):    Make sure you can see the full Live View. You can move the scene to the left and right with the  A / D keys on the keyboard.
